Question:
A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1)Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2)Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3)Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '0' character indicates empty cells.

 Using Backtracking Approach:

 Sudoku can be solved by one by one assigning numbers to empty cells.
 Before assigning a number, check whether it is safe to assign.
 Check that the same number is not present in the current row, current column and current 3X3 subgrid.
 After checking for safety, assign the number, and recursively check whether this assignment leads to a solution or not.
 If the assignment doesnâ€™t lead to a solution,then try the next number for the current empty cell.
 And if none of the number (1 to 9) leads to a solution, return false and print no solution exists.
